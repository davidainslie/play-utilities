Setup
-----

To get you going with this application, just follow along

By using Typesafe's Activator, Scala, SBT and Play will be installed - the following assumes you are using "Homebrew", if not, tough luck:
> brew install typesafe-activator

In a directory where you wish to clone this project from git:
> $ git clone https://github.com/davidainslie/play-utilities.git

Go into the application's new project directory and complete the following:
> $ cd play-utilities

> $ activator

> [play-utilities] $ update-classifiers

> [play-utilities] $ idea sbt-classifiers with-sources=yes

> [play-utilities] $ test

Hopefully all "tests" will pass and you can now open up IntelliJ and start doing some damage.
(Sorry for not including Eclipse, but just replace the above "idea" entry appropriately).

Specs
-----
First take a look at the specs.
They can be run individually in your IDE or from SBT command line console using the "test" command.
